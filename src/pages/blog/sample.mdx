HomeworkSMP is my community Minecraft server where I experiment with governance, build systems, and collaborative projects.

The idea was to combine a vanilla Minecraft experience with structured rules, voting, and a persistent economy. Over the years, it has grown into a global SMP community with players from multiple continents.

## Technical Setup

- Hosted on a dedicated VPS with automated backups
- Vanilla Minecraft + minimal plugins
- Custom scripts for elections, economy, and moderation

## Lessons Learned

Managing a global community taught me a lot about infrastructure, moderation, and sustainable design. Many of these lessons have influenced my personal projects and Veltryx infrastructure philosophy.

        <p class="mb-4 text-neutral-400">Veltryx serves as a personal umbrella organization for all my projects, and this site is my portfolio, documentation space, and playground for experimentation.</p>

        <p class="mb-4 text-neutral-400">Interests include: networking, cloud infrastructure, automation, software tooling, and yes… a little gaming and triathlon.</p>
